a) with old bluetooth dongle,
   connect doesn't work. why???

b) new bluetooth dongle,
   connect works.

https://github.com/pcborenstein/bluezDoc/wiki/hcitool-and-gatttool-example

c) with whitelist added,
   it doesn't get reconnedted without "connnect command".
   why???
   Looks like it's bluez problem. for Non HID devices, it doesn't work well.

d) gatttool
   but this works. make sure you delete all connections by bluetoothctl

   a) sudo hciconfig hci0 down
   b) sudo hciconfig hci0 up

    ### for testing
   1) sudo hcitool leinfo --random XXXX
   2) sudo hcitool lecc --random XXXX
   3) sudo hcitool ledc handle

    ###
   a) sudo gatttool -b DE:4F:1D:7D:FE:B1 -t random -I
   b) connect
   c) primary

   XXX funny thing is the controller is not whitelisted in this way.
   So let's do some study about BLE connection procedure

e) ok with rfConnect android tool, I was able to access and
   read/write values

   what is CCCD? What is the proper way to handle that???

f) CCCD
  guess if there is no notify service, we better leave it as NULL

  XXX FIXME


i) linux doc again
https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/stacks/bluetooth/bluez/docs/reference/gatt-services

   on rapsberry pi

   a) sudo bluetoothctl
   b) scan on
   c) connect XXXX
   e.0) you might have to to menu gatt depending on your bluetoothctl version
   e) list-attributes
   f) select-attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_DE_4F_1D_7D_FE_B1/service000b/char000c
   g) read
   h) write 0xaa
   i) notify on

   misc.
   a) to check bluebooth version
      hciconfig -a

   b) to check BLE states
      sudo hciconfig -a lestates


j) HCI
